# Hello World

This is obviously not my first GitHub repository!

## About Me
I'm a software engineer at SEECS, NUST, learning GitHub and AI-powered development.

## Module 1

- Learned about GitHub codespaces!

- And discovered that it works with VSCode Live Share, although, I don't use that extension much when working in teams. (except when I have to work in a pair programming setup)

- This will surely help boost productivity

- I never knew that VSCode auto-complete suggestions can be used in so many different ways!

- Used co-pilot as usual to generate documentation for the task manager created in module_1 lab.

- Created a task Manager using just autocomplete and code comments

- Added unittests for the task manager (like i always do)

## Module 2

- Learned a lot of useful shortcut keys for using co-pilot suggestions!

- The /explain feature can be quite handy when dealing with other people's code:

- The /fix feature can also be very handy:

- Same goes for the /rewrite feature

- **Reflection on exercise 1 of unit 2**

Use of different modes for different tasks is quite interesting plus useful. I personally prefer using ChatGPT for the "ask" mode, generally, to save premium copilot requests.

However, the "edit" mode is actually useful when we already have the implementation and just need some quick edits for improvements, and I would use that mode from now on.
