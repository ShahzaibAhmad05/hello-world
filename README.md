# Hello World

This is obviously not my first GitHub repository!

## About Me
I'm a software engineer at SEECS, NUST, learning GitHub and AI-powered development.

## Module 1

### Learned about GitHub codespaces!

And discovered that it works with VSCode Live Share, although, I don't use that extension much when working in teams. (except when I have to work in a pair programming setup)

### This will surely help boost productivity

Never knew that VSCode auto-complete suggestions can be used in so many different ways!

Used co-pilot as usual to generate documentation for the task manager created in module_1 lab.

### Created a task Manager using just autocomplete and code comments
