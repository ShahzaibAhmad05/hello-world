My Development Preferences Code Style: Use strict typing, follow PEP8 or Google C++ standards, prefer modular functional components, and use descriptive naming like is_user_authenticated. Testing: Include unit tests (Pytest/JUnit) for all features, maintain 80% coverage, and use mocks for external dependencies. Documentation: Use Docstrings/JSDoc, explain the "why" behind complex logic, and document all environment variables. Security: Use environment variables for secrets, implement OWASP Top 10 mitigations, and use bcrypt or Argon2 for hashing.
